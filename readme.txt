= How does it work? =

bib.ly will find all Bible refences on your site like Mark 5:13 and 2 Cor. 5:17 and convert them to links to the bib.ly website (e.g. <a href="http://bib.ly/Mark5.13">Mark 5:13</a> and <a href="http://bib.ly/2Cor5.17 ">2 Cor. 5:17 </a>) as well as show the Biblical text on a hover card.

= What happens next? =

When users hovers over a link, they'll see the text in a popup. If they click the link, they'll be taken to a site that let's them pick their favorite Bible site (YouVersion, BibleGateway, etc.)

= Future plans? =

We'll add more Bible versions for the popups soon.
